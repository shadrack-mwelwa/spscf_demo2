            <p class="defaultArticle">Shane Perry Smith Christian Foundation is identifying children with cerebral palsy from all
            socio-economic backgrounds irrespective of cultural, financial and geographical barriers. We
            want to increase awareness in society whereby the children with Cerebral Palsy and other
            challenges are recognised early and are being referred to treatment centres. The Foundation
            guides the parents of such children for proper treatment using latest treatment modalities
            available.

        <h2 class="section-header">What is Cerebral Palsy</h2>
        <article>
            <p class="defaultArticle">Cerebral palsy is a group of neuromotor problems that is characterised by difficulty in ambulation 
            & often accompanied with problem in sensation, cognition, perception, communication, vision, speech,
            hearing, immunity, epilepsy, feeding, growth etc.</p>
            <h3 class="subHeading">Facts About Cerebral Palsy</h3>
            <p class="defaultArticle">It is one of the common causes of severe physical disability in childhood. It occurs because of
               “brain insult” during early phase of life from foetal life to 2.5 years of age. Problems like 
                severe jaundice, intrauterine infection, trauma, genetic problem, hypoxia and many unknown 
                causes can cause insult to immature brain during early age of life.<br><br>
                Low birth weight & premature born babies are more prone to cerebral palsy. These children are
                unable to achieve “developmental milestones” as other normal children. These children can be 
                identified at early age by identification of the above-mentioned history, delayed milestone, 
                abnormal social smile, abnormal reflexes, abnormal tone, abnormal movement, abnormal growth 
                pattern and delay in ambulation.<br><br>
                Brain insult is static but, their disabilities can increase, decrease or remain static depending upon
                environment and treatment intervention.
            </p>
            
            <p class="defaultArticle">With early intervention by multimodal therapeutic approach, more than 80% children can have
                good quality of life and more than 60% can have ambulatory life. Mental retardation is found in
                only 40% cases. <br><br>
                These children need medical care by a team of medical and rehab specialists which include
                physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, special educators, an orthopaedic
                surgeon, a neurologist, a paediatrician etc.
                <br><br>
                <img class="whatisCP treatmentHurdleImg" src="img/Joshua a child with cerebral palsy Holding a Ball.JPG" alt="Joshua a child with cerebral palsy Holding a Ball"/>
                <br>
                Cerebral palsy can't be cured but we can decrease the disability to an extent that most of them
                can become self-dependent and can be integrated in main stream schooling & society. They can have a 
                professional degree, can have a job, marry and live a long life.

        <article>
            <p class="defaultArticle">
                According to Stanley (2000) Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common congenital neurologic disorder. The world-wide 
                prevalence of cerebral palsy is 2-2.5/1000 live births.<br><br> 
                Worldwide more than 15 million people are affected with cerebral palsy. In developed countries, advanced facilities 
                like institutional care, proper documentation, gait labs, social security, inclusive education, advanced rehab 
                modalities are available. In the last two decades many new rehabilitation techniques have been discovered which 
                has resulted in better living standards of these children.

        <h2 class="section-header scenarioZm"> The Zambian Scenario</h2>
        <article>
          <p class="defaultArticle">Many Children diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy end up dying in early stages of life. They are sometimes
                considered to be a burden and curse to their families. They are stigmatized. Many educational
                institutions shun them as they do not have facilities for them, denying them their right to basic
                education.<br><br>
                These children are not treated well in most health facilities. Parents are left to be frustrated with these
                children. It looks like society has no place for them and many parents do not see a bright
                future. 
                <br><br>Meanwhile these children, given the necessary help, can not only, reach their full potential but
                also have an impact in society and the world. It must be noted that children with Cerebral Palsy are
                most of the time intellectually able to learn anything. They are able to think abstract and early
                interventions could help them have a relatively better life.</p>
                
          <h3 class="subHeading lvls">Levels of Prevalence and Access to Treatment</h3>
          <p class="defaultArticle">There is over 3000 children living with Cerebral Palsy in Zambia. 
                Despite the high prevelance of this condition in Zambia, there are no medical facilities to 
                offer rehabilitation services to children with Cerebral Palsy. Compounding this already sad 
                state of affairs is the high price of Medication for children with Cerebral Palsy. 
                Especially for the children who suffer from seizures. <br>

                  Some resort to traditional therapy which is in fact harmful for such children. 
                  They face many difficulties because of lack of standardized treatment regiment, non availability of advanced and 
                  multimodal rehab measures.<br><br>
                  Difficulty in getting consultation from various specialty fields of medicine in a single place, difficulty in staying 
                  away from their home at rehab centre for long term treatment and no knowledge about future directions and prognosis 
                  of the disorder.<br><br>
                  Almost all of them face financial problems in the long run. Many face psychological problems, and without clear medical 
                  advice they stop treatment all together.
