                    socio-economic backgrounds irrespective of cultural, financial and geographical barriers.
                    The Foundation guides the parents of such children to take their children for proper treatment 
                    using latest treatment modalities available. We have identified Stem Cell therapy to be the best  
                    form of intervention so far.

                        In Stem cell therapy a small needle is injected into the hip to take out bone marrow. This is done under
                        local anaesthesia. 
                        <br><br>Then the specimen is taken to a laboratory, where the bone marrow is separated from
                        the Stem Cells. The stem cells are then taken and injected back into the patient's body. Where they will
                        now go to the damaged areas of the body and accumulate, regenerate, and the body will expel the dead
                        Stem Cells. 
                        <br><br>Therefore we only see a change after 3 months of treatment, however the patient has to
                        undergo extensive rehabilitation after the stem cell therapy treatment. Then results are checked every 6
                        months after treatment.
